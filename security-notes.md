Vulnerability scan: Also known as vulnerability assessments, vulnerability scans assess computers, systems, and networks for security weaknesses, also known as vulnerabilities. These scans are typically automated and give a beginning look at what could possibly be exploited.

Penetration test: A penetration test simulates a hacker attempting to get into a business system through hands-on research and the exploitation of vulnerabilities. Actual analysts, often called ethical hackers, search for vulnerabilities and then try to prove that they can be exploited. Using methods like password cracking, buffer overflow, and SQL injection, they attempt to compromise and extract data from a network in a non damaging way.

The article titled "OWASP Top 10 Cheat Sheet for Startup CTOs" provides a concise summary of the top 10 security vulnerabilities outlined by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and offers guidance for startup CTOs to address these risks effectively. Here is a summary of the key points covered in the article:

- Injection: Injection attacks occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. To mitigate this risk, use prepared statements or parameterized queries and implement input validation.

- Broken Authentication: Weak authentication and session management can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts. Ensure secure password storage, implement multi-factor authentication, and monitor for suspicious activities.

- Sensitive Data Exposure: If sensitive data is not properly protected, it can be compromised. Use encryption to secure sensitive information both at rest and in transit, and follow security best practices for data handling.

- XML External Entities (XXE): This vulnerability allows attackers to read internal files or execute arbitrary code. Disable XML external entity processing and validate XML inputs.

- Broken Access Control: Inadequate access controls can allow unauthorized users to view or manipulate sensitive data. Implement proper authentication, authorization, and role-based access control to prevent unauthorized access.

- Security Misconfigurations: Incorrectly configured systems can provide entry points for attackers. Regularly update software, apply security patches, and follow secure configuration practices.

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS attacks enable attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Implement output encoding and input validation to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

- Insecure Deserialization: Malicious deserialization can lead to remote code execution. Avoid deserialization of untrusted data and validate serialized objects before processing.

- Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Using outdated or vulnerable components can expose your application to attacks. Keep software dependencies up to date and monitor for security advisories.

- Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: Inadequate logging and monitoring make it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents. Implement logging mechanisms and establish monitoring practices to identify and investigate suspicious activities.

The article emphasizes the importance of understanding these vulnerabilities and implementing appropriate security measures to protect startup applications from potential attacks. It also suggests leveraging security frameworks and regularly conducting security assessments to ensure ongoing protection against evolving threats.
